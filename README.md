# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

## Introduction
This repository documents my 100 Days of Coding Journey - a self-driven initiative to strengthen and expand my programming and data skills.

This challenge is a personal commitment for continuious learning and skill improvement. Each project represents a small step towards mastering my journey in data storytelling - transforming raw data into valuable insights. 

By sharing this project publically, I aim to: 

* Stay accountable for ongoing personal growth and improvement
* Contribute to the data community through open learning
* Build a strong portfolio that reflects technical proficiency and analytical thinking

Over the next 100 days, I will complete small, focused projects designed to reinforce and refine different data skills:
* Python
* SQL
* Machine Learning
* Report Writing
* Data Presentation

## Objectives
* Reinforce and refine my fundamental skills with Python and SQL
* Explore real-world datasets to practice data cleaning, visualizations, and storytelling
* Building my skills and improving confidence in machine learning workflow with hands on experiences
* Maintain constant learning habits and showcase my progress
* Share projects to inspire other professionals that want to learn data skills or struggle to improve their skills
