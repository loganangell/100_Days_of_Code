## Project: Green Bay Packer Dashboard Day 2

After looking over the code I made yesterday, I decided to make a few updates:
1. Change some magic numbers into variables for readability and context
2. Updated the code to remove records with incomplete game log in 2025 (for purposes of using data only with full data
3. Formatting and editing for seeing the code execute in terminal

After updating the code, I decided to start on laying out the dashboard:
1. Design the dashboard to reflect Green Bay Packer colors and decals
2. Create interactivity with icons to move between dashboards

Tomorrow, I will plan to continue designing the layout of the dashboard and start integrating statistics that a stakeholder may find insightful when looking at data from the 2016 to 2025 seasons.

Refer to the 'Packer_Dashboard' repository for the project.
